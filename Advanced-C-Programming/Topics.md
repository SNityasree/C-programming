# Standards
## C99 Standard:
bool datatype - stdbool.h (added true/false keywords)
variable Length arrays
single line comments
C11: header file: <threads.h>
- multi threading support, safe standard support.
- the standard also attempts to fix some issues presented in C99
## example C89 standards:
int i;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)

## example c99 standards:
for( int i=0;i<n;i++)

## example c11 standards:

begin or end with _s (strcat_s, strcpy_s)

C89 is most widely used so focus on that
